Description:

This C++ code calculates the range of a resistor's capacity (in ohms) based on its color code. By entering the colors of the resistor's bands, including the tolerance band, the program determines the lower and upper limits of the capacity range. The code utilizes a color code mapping and applies calculations to derive the capacity range considering the tolerance percentage. The resulting range is then displayed to the user. This program is a handy tool for electronics enthusiasts and professionals in determining the acceptable capacity range for resistors.
